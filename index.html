    <h1>Bounce - A Visual Basic project for a ball bouncing.</h1><br />
    <h2>Links to the various versions:</h2><br />
    <p>
        This project is an attempt to create the Sam Davis sample project from Chapter 8 of his Year 12 text for Software Design &amp; Development course. (NSW HSC syllabus, Australia).</p>
    Students are welcome to fork the project to date, but there are many more parts to complete.
    A little more is done each year when the project comes around.

    <h2>Student versions:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bwattle/28-Bounce-VB/releases/download/v3.01/Bounce.exe">
        v3.01 </a>- Callum's version with the trail - Still some bugs, but the ball size, speed and colour all work. Changing the colour while the ball is moving creates great patterns. No VB files for this version.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bwattle/28-Bounce-VB/releases/download/v2.02/Bounce-Ben.exe">
        v4.01 </a>- Ben's version which changes colour on click - Speed, size and colour all working. At one stage the ball stuck to the side, but making 100 fixed that. Looks great!</p>
